### Feb - Mar 2017 Update

The above paragraph is the text from the original readme file.

I forked Zeldman's GitHub page at <https://github.com/studiozeldman/poynter-style-guide-2017>

A working sample article that uses Zeldman's design ideas can be found at <https://studiozeldman.github.io/poynter-reader-2017> with the GitHub repo for that page found [here](https://github.com/studiozeldman/poynter-reader-2017).


I'm adding supporting links to this interesting Poynter project.

### March 2017 formatting changes

I added more test text to the article body in index.html.

I made small changes to style.css that satisfy my interests.

My test page:

<http://testcode.soupmode.com/zeldman/poynter-style-guide-2017/index.html>

On a desktop/laptopl computer, the original page fount at:

<https://studiozeldman.github.io/poynter-style-guide-2017>

causes a horizontal scrollbar to appear, especially when resizing the browser to a smaller size. A media query accounts for this when viewing the page on a smaller device, but I don't want to see the horizontal scrollbar on any screen.

For `div.content1` in style.css, I changed `width: 600px;` to `max-width: 600px;` and I added `width: 100%;`.`
