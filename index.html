    <p><span class="dropcap">W</span>ise men say only fools rush in. Others say that the more typefaces you use, the less cohesive your design will feel. And on the web, that also means more loading time for your visitors. Choose a typeface for body text and another for display usage and you should be all set for most projects.</p>

    <p>It rubs the lotion on its skin. Well, hello, Clarice. We begin by coveting what we see every day. Don’t you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice? And don’t your eyes seek out the things you want? After your father’s murder, you were orphaned. You were ten years old. You went to live with cousins on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana. They were slaughtering the spring lambs? All praise to the Typecast element list, originally created by John Martins at typecast.com.</p>

<h3>JRS: Added more text for testing</h3>

<p>
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
</p>

<p>
It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
</p>

<p>
It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
